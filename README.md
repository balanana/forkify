Here you find my first big project: _Forkify_

***

_Forkify_ is a app designed for food enthiusiasts, it allows the user to :

* get a list of recipes according to the keyword search
* checkout the selected recipe's list of ingredients and serving
* add the servings to the shopping list by clicking on the "Add to shopping list" button
* favorite a specific recipe by clicking on the heart in the middle
* consult the list of favorite recipes (stored in the browser's localStorage) by clicking on the heart in the top right corner
* get directions on how to cook the recipe itself
